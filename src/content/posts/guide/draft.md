# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Tables can look like this:

size material color

---

9 leather brown
10 hemp canvas natural
11 glass transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

---

keyword text

---

red Sunsets, apples, and
other red or reddish
things.

green Leaves, grass, frogs
and other things it's
not easy being.

---

A horizontal rule follows.

---

Here's a definition list:

apples
: Good for making applesauce.
oranges
: Citrus!
tomatoes
: There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
| Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

[//]: # (![example image]&#40;./demo-banner.png "An exemplary image"&#41;)

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\pi
=3.1415926535
 \;8979323846\;2643383279\;5028841971\;6939937510\;5820974944
 \;5923078164\;0628620899\;8628034825\;3421170679\;\ldots
\end{equation*}
$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.

Here, we'll explore how code blocks look using [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/). The provided examples are based on the official documentation, which you can refer to for further details.

## Expressive Code

### Syntax Highlighting

[Syntax Highlighting](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/syntax-highlighting/)

#### Regular syntax highlighting

```js
console.log('This code is syntax highlighted!')
```

#### Rendering ANSI escape sequences

```ansi
ANSI colors:
- Regular: [31mRed[0m [32mGreen[0m [33mYellow[0m [34mBlue[0m [35mMagenta[0m [36mCyan[0m

```

### Editor & Terminal Frames

[Editor & Terminal Frames](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/frames/)

#### Code editor frames

```js title="my-test-file.js"
console.log('Title attribute example')
```

---

```html
<!-- src/content/index.html -->
<div>File name comment example</div>
```

#### Terminal frames

```bash
echo "This terminal frame has no title"
```

---

```powershell title="PowerShell terminal example"
Write-Output "This one has a title!"
```

#### Overriding frame types

```sh frame="none"
echo "Look ma, no frame!"
```

---

```ps frame="code" title="PowerShell Profile.ps1"
# Without overriding, this would be a terminal frame
function Watch-Tail { Get-Content -Tail 20 -Wait $args }
New-Alias tail Watch-Tail
```

### Text & Line Markers

[Text & Line Markers](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/)

#### Marking full lines & line ranges

```js {1, 4, 7-8}
// Line 1 - targeted by line number
// Line 2
// Line 3
// Line 4 - targeted by line number
// Line 5
// Line 6
// Line 7 - targeted by range "7-8"
// Line 8 - targeted by range "7-8"
```

#### Selecting line marker types (mark, ins, del)

```js title="line-markers.js" del={2} ins={3-4} {6}
function demo() {
  console.log('this line is marked as deleted')
  // This line and the next one are marked as inserted
  console.log('this is the second inserted line')

  return 'this line uses the neutral default marker type'
}
```

#### Adding labels to line markers

```jsx {"1":5} del={"2":7-8} ins={"3":10-12}
// labeled-line-markers.jsx
<button
  role="button"
  {...props}
  value={value}
  className={buttonClassName}
  disabled={disabled}
  active={active}
>
  {children &&
    !active &&
    (typeof children === 'string' ? <span>{children}</span> : children)}
</button>
```

#### Adding long labels on their own lines

```jsx {"1. Provide the value prop here:":5-6} del={"2. Remove the disabled and active states:":8-10} ins={"3. Add this to render the children inside the button:":12-15}
// labeled-line-markers.jsx
<button
  role="button"
  {...props}

  value={value}
  className={buttonClassName}

  disabled={disabled}
  active={active}
>

  {children &&
    !active &&
    (typeof children === 'string' ? <span>{children}</span> : children)}
</button>
```

#### Using diff-like syntax

```diff
+this line will be marked as inserted
-this line will be marked as deleted
this is a regular line
```

---

```diff
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
+this is an actual diff file
-all contents will remain unmodified
 no whitespace will be removed either
```

#### Combining syntax highlighting with diff-like syntax

```diff lang="js"
  function thisIsJavaScript() {
    // This entire block gets highlighted as JavaScript,
    // and we can still add diff markers to it!
-   console.log('Old code to be removed')
+   console.log('New and shiny code!')
  }
```

#### Marking individual text inside lines

```js "given text"
function demo() {
  // Mark any given text inside lines
  return 'Multiple matches of the given text are supported';
}
```

#### Regular expressions

```ts /ye[sp]/
console.log('The words yes and yep will be marked.')
```

#### Escaping forward slashes

```sh /\/ho.*\//
echo "Test" > /home/test.txt
```

#### Selecting inline marker types (mark, ins, del)

```js "return true;" ins="inserted" del="deleted"
function demo() {
  console.log('These are inserted and deleted marker types');
  // The return statement uses the default marker type
  return true;
}
```

### Word Wrap

[Word Wrap](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/word-wrap/)

#### Configuring word wrap per block

```js wrap
// Example with wrap
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

---

```js wrap=false
// Example with wrap=false
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

#### Configuring indentation of wrapped lines

```js wrap preserveIndent
// Example with preserveIndent (enabled by default)
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

---

```js wrap preserveIndent=false
// Example with preserveIndent=false
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

## Collapsible Sections

[Collapsible Sections](https://expressive-code.com/plugins/collapsible-sections/)

```js collapse={1-5, 12-14, 21-24}
// All this boilerplate setup code will be collapsed
import { someBoilerplateEngine } from '@example/some-boilerplate'
import { evenMoreBoilerplate } from '@example/even-more-boilerplate'

const engine = someBoilerplateEngine(evenMoreBoilerplate())

// This part of the code will be visible by default
engine.doSomething(1, 2, 3, calcFn)

function calcFn() {
  // You can have multiple collapsed sections
  const a = 1
  const b = 2
  const c = a + b

  // This will remain visible
  console.log(`Calculation result: ${a} + ${b} = ${c}`)
  return c
}

// All this code until the end of the block will be collapsed again
engine.closeConnection()
engine.freeMemory()
engine.shutdown({ reason: 'End of example boilerplate code' })
```

## Line Numbers

[Line Numbers](https://expressive-code.com/plugins/line-numbers/)

### Displaying line numbers per block

```js showLineNumbers
// This code block will show line numbers
console.log('Greetings from line 2!')
console.log('I am on line 3')
```

---

```js showLineNumbers=false
// Line numbers are disabled for this block
console.log('Hello?')
console.log('Sorry, do you know what line I am on?')
```

### Changing the starting line number

```js showLineNumbers startLineNumber=5
console.log('Greetings from line 5!')
console.log('I am on line 6')
```
